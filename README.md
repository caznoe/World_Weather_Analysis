# World Weather Analysis

Created a list of cities corresponding to random coordinates set using numPy. Used OpenWeather Map API to gather the JSON weather data for the cities and append to the DataFrame. Using this DataFrame, created an app within Jupyter Notebooks that asks users their preference on temperature, rain and snow to recommend vacation locations. The resulting map layer provides weather data and local hotels gathered through Google Maps API. 
This project was part of UC Berkeley Data Analytics Boot Camp.
